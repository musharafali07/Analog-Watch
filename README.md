# Analog-Watch
An analog watch is a type of watch that uses hands to indicate the time on a circular dial. The hands of an analog watch move around the dial in a continuous motion, with the shorter hand (the minute hand) indicating the minutes and the longer hand  indicating the hours. Some analog watches also have a third hand that indicates the seconds.
